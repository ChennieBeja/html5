			<h1>Chocolates</h1>
	<p> is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of Theobroma cacao seeds, roasted and ground.
	It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. 
	Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. 
	The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BCE. 
	In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as xocolātl Nahuatl pronunciation: [ʃoˈkolaːt͡ɬ], a Nahuatl word meaning "bitter water". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor.</p>

			<h1>The original meaning of chocolate</h1>
	
	<p> The English word ‘chocolate’ comes ultimately from the Nahuatl word chocolatl, an edible substance made from, amongst other ingredients, the seeds of the cacao tree. When the first Spanish explorers encountered chocolatl in Central  America, they apparently mixed it up with the word cacahuatl, the name of a drink made from cacao.</p>
